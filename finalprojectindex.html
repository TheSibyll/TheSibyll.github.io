			<summary>My Childhood</summary>
				<p>I grew up in a small estate in Lagos, a bustling commercial city in Nigeria. Studied in Europe from my teens to early adudlthood, big european cities comes with so much light pollutions, but i never really stopped star gazing. I missed the clear sprawling night sky i could see from my balcony in Lagos, nice to be back home for a bit.</p>
